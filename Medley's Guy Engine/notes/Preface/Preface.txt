<Notice>

	1.	This engine basically support skin, item, backstep, and achievement system but if you don't want them,
		just turn off them with macros in "initialize_world" script.

	2.	I couldn't find ways to resolve errors and warnings from feather message. 
		(Especially when i make a scribble object, i must face the error message.)
		If you mind it, just right-click to ignore messages or disable feather.
		
	3.	If the player uses pause system (simple pause & settings screen), instance_deactivate_all and
		instance_activate_all are called and these causes change of instances' creation order in the layer.
		So if you should strictly seperate the creation order, use layers.
		
	4.	Sorry for bad english in general comments :(
