Medley's Guy Engine (MGE)

<Notice>

	1.	This engine basically support skin, item, backstep, achievement system, ETC. 
        but if you don't want them, just turn off them with macros in "initialize_world" script.
		
	2.	If the player uses pause system (simple pause & settings screen), instance_deactivate_all and
		instance_activate_all are called and these causes change of instances' creation order in the layer.
		So if you should strictly seperate the creation order, use layers.
		
    3.  If error occurs just by compiling, delete save data folder in AppData
